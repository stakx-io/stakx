"From there to here, from here to there, funny things are everywhere" ... So begins this classic Beginner Book by Dr. Seuss. Beginning with just five fish and continuing into flights of fancy, *One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish* celebrates how much fun imagination can be. From the can-opening Zans to the boxing Gox to the winking Yink who drinks pink ink, the silly rhymes and colorful cast of characters create an entertaining approach to reading that will have every child giggling from morning to night: "Today is gone. Today was fun. Tomorrow is another one."

Originally created by Dr. Seuss, Beginner Books encourage children to read all by themselves, with simple words and illustrations that give clues to their meaning.
